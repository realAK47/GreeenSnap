# GreenSnap

## Problem Statements
- The Initial enthusiasm of planting trees which is often followed by the absence of it’s continuous monitoring and maintenance 
- Poor yield due to late detection of plant diseases
- Unawareness among local communities about job opportunities which promote sustainable development

## GreenSnap - App Features
GreenSnap is a simple solution to all the above problems. It’s an app which encourages people to plant more trees.

#### Features:
1) Plant a tree 
2) Plant Disease Detection using Internet of Things(IoT) and Machine Learning(ML)
3) Buy/Sell 

- Plant a Tree

Donate Money for a plant - included to address the worries of those who wish to plant more trees but are unable to due to various constraints like time and effort. We also plan to include a feature through which the donor is connected to the person who would be receiving the free plant, which in turn helps to keep a rapport between both the parties.

- Get a Plant
In this we give away seedlings absolutely free for the registered users. The only prerequisite is that they must take good care of what they are provided with, which includes updating the database on their plant’s growth. Hence, we make use of machine learning techniques to assess the photos which ultimately decides on whether a user is eligible to receive free seedlings/plants in the near future.  

We have also enabled a feature through which a user can share their plant’s progress on social media.


 #### Plant Disease Detection using Internet of Things(IoT) and Machine Learning(ML)
Regular monitoring of plants ensures proper growth and thereby, makes sures that the yield is of good quality. With the help of the new age technologies, this process can be automated which in turn saves time and effort. 
Here, machine learning is used to detect leaf diseases by matching the image with the most suitable option.

We have also provided the necessary details with which people can get started on IoT kits, that help with the early detection of disease and pest symptoms, which in turn would increase the chances of plant survival.

- Buy/Sell
This feature is introduced to encourage people to plant more and as a result, get an additional income too. This also reduces post harvest losses. 

## Results
More plants leading to reduced carbon dioxide levels thereby tackling the problem of climate change.
Encouraging people to plant more and monitor them efficiently.
Promoting sustainable development and attaining self-sufficiency.
Ensures food safety - as everything is grown in homes.
Quality assurance and reduced consumption of resources - continuous monitoring by making use of technologies like Internet of Things(IoT) and Machine Learning(ML).
Encourages Buying and selling arrangements within the local community.
Ensures additional income especially during the pandemic.

## Conclusions

The ultimate purpose of this project is to make sure that the Earth is well preserved for the future generations and make known the fact that technology was indeed created so that we could help better our environment and not go against it.
A new Flutter project.
